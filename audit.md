# Repository Audit

## Folder Structure

- The **`blog`** folder contains the blog post files for the project in Markdown and Yaml format.

- The **`docs`** folder holds the documentation pages and folders for the project.

- The **`pages`** folder contains the custom pages of the project.

- The **`src`** folder has the css and js files.

- The **`static`** folder has assets and images that are required in the project.

## Observations

The folders follow the structure used in the Docusaurus template.

`README.md` can describe what the repo is about while `overview.md` can be moved to docs folder and describe the modules

## Improvements

The naming convention is not consistent, for instance, in the folder `blog`, some files start with a date, while others start with the name.

There should be clear entry points, for instance, adding a `getting-started.md` file for each content type.

Create a structured navigation for `docs/tutorials/` to centralize learning materials as content increases.
